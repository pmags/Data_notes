**Basicamente este paper estuda o impacto nos capital requirements da divis√£o em classes tendo 'por base ter o mesmo numero de empresas por classe de rate. Neste caso fica dificil comparar entre anos uma vez que o limite de cada um dos intervalores pode variar**

In this initial attempt to explore the issue of calibration, we restricted our research to _static methods_. **This implies that the estimates of probabilities of default are based on one-year transitional rates, and the classification into rating classes relates to a single point in time in each of the years**.

Classification by relative frequency of default (hereinafter referred to as frequency analysis) denotes the construction of rating classes through counting Classification by relative frequency of default (hereinafter referred to as frequency analysis) denotes the construction of rating classes through counting processes that are directly based on the credit standing index (score).

For this purpose, the enterprises are sorted by score and then assigned to a specified number of classes (e.g. class 1: score 100 to 200 etc.). **One possible classification approach is to keep the number of companies per class more or less constant (uniform distribution of companies), with operationalization, for example, being effected by applying the following standard: Given ten rating classes, 10% of the companies are assigned to each rating class, while in the case of five rating classes each class contains 20% of the companies, etc.** This approach has been adopted in the present study.

Another possible variant is the approach pursued in the study by _Lawrenz and Schwaiger (2002)_, which the present study builds on. It requires ex ante definition of the share in total defaults of eachra ting category (predefined default profile). Both methods use the relative frequency of defaults in the respective class as the estimator for the probability of default (PD).

3.2.2 Calibration and Formation of Classes Calibration was based on the assumption that our sample exhibits the same default level as the universe, i.e. that it is sufficiently large and representative. The classification into classes using the logistic approach was also subject to the rule that approximately the same number of companies had to be assigned to eachra ting class.
