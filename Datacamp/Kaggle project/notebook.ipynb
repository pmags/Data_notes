Welcome to the world of data science\n<p>Throughout the world of data science, there are many languages and tools that can be used to complete a given task. While you are often able to use whichever tool you prefer, it is often important for analysts to work with similar platforms so that they can share their code with one another. Learning what professionals in the data science industry use while at work can help you gain a better understanding of things that you may be asked to do in the future. </p>\n<p>In this project, we are going to find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work.
